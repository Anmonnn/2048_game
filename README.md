# Game 2048
  - [DEMO LINK](https://anmonnn.github.io/2048_game/)

This project is an implementation of the popular 2048 game. The goal of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game features a dynamic and responsive interface that updates the game state based on user input via keyboard arrow keys. The project emphasizes clear visual feedback for user actions and incorporates game-over and victory conditions.

Technologies Used:
- HTML: The structure of the game is built using HTML, defining the layout of the game board, controls, and messages.
- CSS (SCSS): Styling and layout are handled using SCSS, a CSS preprocessor that allows for the use of variables, mixins, and other features to keep the styles organized and maintainable.
- JavaScript: The core game logic is implemented in JavaScript, handling the game mechanics, user interactions, and updates to the game state and UI.

Key Features:
- Dynamic Game Board: The game board updates in real-time based on user inputs.
- Responsive Design: The game is designed to be playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- User Feedback: Visual cues are provided for game start, game over, and victory conditions.
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the user's score and updates it as tiles are combined.
